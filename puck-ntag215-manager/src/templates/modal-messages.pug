  when "save-to-flash"
    p Do you want to save written tag data to the flash storage of the puck?
    p If this feature is not enabled, the tags stored on the puck will be lost when the battery dies or if it is removed.
    p This may reduce the life of the puck due to the additional writes to the flash storage.

  when "debug-mode"
    p Do you want to enable debug mode?
    p This will enable log output and use "Serial1" as a console when fast mode is enabled.

  when "dfu-instructions"
    p To enter DFU mode, please remove the battery from your Puck.js and re-insert it while holding the power button until the LED indicator turns green.
